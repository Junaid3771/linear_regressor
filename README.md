 
Linear Regressor is a Python-based machine learning project that implements linear regression functionality. The project is organized with separate directories for models, notebooks, and web templates, along with a main application file. However, the repository currently lacks detailed documentation and appears to be in early development stages with minimal community engagement (0 stars, 0 forks, 0 watchers).

### Main Function Points
- Linear regression model implementation
- Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis
- Web application interface using Flask/templates for model interaction
- Python-based machine learning pipeline
- Model persistence in the models directory

### Technology Stack
- Python (65.1% of codebase)
- HTML (34.9% of codebase)
- Web framework (Flask-based structure indicated by templates directory)
- Jupyter Notebooks for data science workflows

### License
No license information is currently specified in the repository.
